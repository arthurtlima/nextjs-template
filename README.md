This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate to be used other projects.

## üöÄ How to run the project

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Additionally, it's good to have an editor for working with the code, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Run the project

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:arthurtlima/nextjs-template.git

# But if you want to create a new project without including all the previous commits, run this command.
$ npm create-next-app --example https://github.com/arthurtlima/nextjs-template

# After defining the project name, access the project folder in your terminal/cmd.

# Access the project folder in your terminal/cmd.
$ cd project-name

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the application in development mode.
$ yarn dev

# The project will be opened at port 3000 - access http://localhost:3000
```

Feel free to choose if you want to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### üíª Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
- `storybook`: runs storybook on `localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook

### üõ† Technologies

The following tools were used in the project's construction:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
